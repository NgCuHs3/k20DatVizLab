                    Originated from Wuhan (China) in the end of 2019 onwards, Covid-19 pandemic has been causing 253
                    million cases, 5.09 million deaths (WHO 9/11). The pandemic develops in a complicated way in 215
                    nations and territories. New cases have been detected everyday. America tops the list with 46,9
                    million cases, 761 thousand deaths, followed by India. Covid-19 is such a pressing issue that the
                    whole world are trying to deal with. But we are living in an era that a new vaccine can be rolled
                    out every 9 months, therefore, it becomes a turning point to terminate the pandemic. The Covid
                    outbreak spread out in a large scale. The outbreak has been difficult to predict and it had a big
                    impact on wide range of social economic industries. Specifically, the global supply chain of goods
                    and services has been interrupted. Some activities such as import, export, tourism, accomodation,
                    restaurant, health service were directly affected. Jobs have been lost, millions of workers have
                    filed for unemployment. Corporations went into bankruptcy or halted operations and underwent a
                    reduction in its size. Even developed nations have had a hard time curbing the rapid spread of the
                    viruses. Although we are in difficult time, the advent of vaccines have shed a light on a solution
                    to the end of pandemic. Numbers and figures in this analytic research will demonstrate that Covid-19
                    vaccinations are working very well.

<div class="paragrah">
<p>
                            This graph show full vaccination rate among countries in the world. People got 2 shots are
                            consider full vaccinated.
                        </p>
<p> As can be seen from the graph, nations in North America region, especially United States
                            has the rate
                            of 75%. Representatives of East Asia region, including Japan, China, South Korea has the
                            full
                            vaccination ratio of 75%, 74.26%, 77.96% respectively. Among countries with the highest full
                            vaccination
                            rate, we can take some examples with Australia 68.94%, countries in European Union such as
                            England,
                            France, Germany, Italia, Spain with the rate of 67.39%, 68.55%, 66.91%, 72.44%, 80.1%
                            respectively.
                        </p>
<p>Countries with the lowest vaccination rate mainly locate on continent Africa. South
                            Africa has just a
                            22.19% full vaccination rate, but this number is the highest in Africa. The rest of the
                            region has
                            really low rate, even under 1%. The most populous country in South Asia, India has the rate
                            of 26%. For
                            some nations in ASEAN, the figures in Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar are generally moderate with
                            33.49%, 37.63%,
                            15.05% respectively.
                        </p>
<p>Obviously from analysis above, regions or countries which are in the top of
                            vaccination race, are
                            developed economies or has produced their own vaccine to provide for citizens. For example,
                            Moderna is a
                            vaccine brand from American manufacturer, Astra Zeneca belongs to a England-Sweden company,
                            Pfizer is
                            the vaccine product from American-German corporation, Spunik of Russia, China also has their
                            own vaccine
                            product named Sinopharm – Sinovax.
                        </p>
<p>On the contrary, developing nations generally have lower full vaccination rate
                            compared with developed
                            ones. They have limited budget and technology progress to develop vaccines and therefore
                            they are
                            dependent on other supplies or humanitarian aid.

<b>1.GDP per capita index</b>
<p>
                            Western Europe takes the lead in terms of GDP per capita. It consists of 9 members :
                            Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands and
                            Switzerland. The main feature of this region is that its nations have relatively equal
                            social economic development. Additionally, there are some countries having the strongest
                            financial ability in the entire European Union.
                        </p>
<p>
                            The region with second highest GDP per capita index is East Asia. China, Japan, South
                            Korea has impressively high GDP per capita but discrepancy as regards development in this
                            region such as wealthy gap between those 3 countries listed and Mongolia or North Korea, has
                            caused it to lag behind Western Europe counterpart.
                        </p>
<p>
                            Regions follow Western Europe and East Asia are Australia and New Zealand, Middle East,
                            North America, Southern Europe. They have similar index and specifically in a small range
                            (64 – 72). Middle East is politically unstable but they have a massive oil reserve so that
                            this index are not low as expected. The index of South East Asia is quite low because major
                            of this region are developing nations.
                        </p>
<p>
                            The lowest index in these 8 regions belongs to South Asia (15.42). That is reasonable
                            because this region is highly populous but the economies are not compatible with scale of
                            population.
                        </p>
<b>2.Human development index</b>
<p>Australia and New Zealand region is at the top of the list, followed by Western Europe
                            (98.91), Southern Europe (93.71), North America (93.65), East Asia (91.35). Of the lower
                            part HDI in these 8 regions, Middle East and South East Asia has indices of 80.62 and 76.6
                            respectively. Again, South Asia has the lowest number for this criteria in these 8
                            regions.We can see that GDP per capita and HDI have a relative correlation. This totally
                            makes
                            sense because the rich countries would have more budget and resources to improve citizen’s
                            living standard.</p>
<b>3.Hospital beds per thousand</b>
<p>East Asia is the best region in terms of this public health facility index. Considering
                            China
                            as an example for East Asia, this most populous country quickly responded to the outbreak by
                            building makeshift hospitals. Those temporary hospitals have helped China fighting against
                            pandemic effectively.
                            Western Europe has the second most hospital beds per thousand. With strong financial
                            ablity,
                            they can build a lot of health facilities to serve their citizens. But majority of people
                            lacked
                            enough caution, new cases increased so rapidly that it overloaded the health care system.
                        </p>
<p>Southern Europe region, Australia and New Zealand region both have relatively high
                            economic
                            strength but the number of beds did not meet patient demand.
                            North America, South East Asia and Middle East has very low number of hospital beds per
                            thousand compared to that East Asia and Western Europe, just approximately one-third.
                            Finally, not surprising, South Asia has the least number of hospital beds among these 8
                            regions. South Asia is home to many populous countries (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh) but
                            these countries has moderate social-economic development.
                        </p>
<b>4.Stringency index</b>
<p>As described in Our World in Data website, The stringency index is a composite measure
                            based on nine response indicators including school closures, workplace closures, and travel
                            bans, rescaled to a value from 0 to 100.
                        </p>
<p>The polar plot indicates that region of Australia and New Zealand have the strictest
                            social distancing measure. It is proved that this is wise action from the two government due
                            to shortage in number of beds available to patients.
                            The second strictest is South East Asia with relatively successful measure against the
                            viruses. Not only low GDP per capita but also limited hospital beds, SEA nations need to
                            adopt strict measures to tackle the problem For example, quick response from Vietnam’s
                            government has contained the viruses in first 3 wave of Covid 19, which enable GDP growth to
                            be positive during that period.
                        </p>
<p>North America and Southern Europe come next with number 75.51 and 73.2 respectively.
                            Although the new cases were increasing at a rapid rate in America and Mexico, the two
                            governments were still indifference in taking firm measures like Canada. Southern Europe had
                            adopted some social distancing rule but they were still subjective with wide vaccination
                            process. In Eastern Europe (64.43), people did not seem to concern pandemic. On special
                            days, people still gathered in public places despite alert from local government.
                            Governments in Middle East were moderately cautious about the complicated condition (64.98).
                        </p>
<p>The region which seems to be the most apathetic in these 8 regions is South Asia. India
                            can be taken as an solid example for South Asia. India experienced one of the worst
                            atrocious period of fighting against the Covid-19. Indeed, India imposed lockdown nationwide
                            at first stage of pandemic. However, when lockdown had adverse effect on economic
                            activities, citizen’s daily life, especially people living under poverty line. Therefore,
                            governments did not impose another quarantine. To sum up, this region have been facing
                            dilemma whether to shut down activities for public health concern or to open nation borders
                            for economic priority.</p>

<p>Sunbusrt plot shows the share of vaccines given and deaths by regions as of November 2, 2021.
                        </p>
<p>Moving into more detail, North America and South Asia are considered to be the hotbed of
                            pandemic, with really high death tolls. United States accounts for a major part of death
                            tolls
                            in North America, whereas India takes up large portion of number in South Asia.
                            Although South Asia has shot 1 461 588 725 doses, Covid-19 has claimed 679 966 lives in this
                            region. To account for this phenomenon, this region not only consists of many developing
                            countries with high population, but also lacks of sufficient health facilities and proactive
                            measures.
                        </p>
<p>These results can be interpreted by reusing polar plot : Both North America and South Asia
                            have poor health facilities and did not impose strict lockdown to curb the viruses. The two
                            regions are not performing well even we take GDP per capita and HDI into consideration.
                            These
                            are the most obvious evidence show why these two regions are the hotbed of Covid pandemic.
                            East Asia has the most share of vaccine globally and this is one reason to show why death
                            tolls are surprisingly low despite of biggest population. Immunization campaign had a
                            positive
                            impact, it was successful in containing severe cases in East Asia. China has very high
                            vaccination rate due to the fact that this country can develop their own vaccine from early
                            stage and number of products can meet massive demand of citizens.
                        </p>
<p>Again, the polar plot which we mentioned can be used to explain the impressive success of
                            East
                            Asia in tackling the Covid problem: East Asia have impressively high index in terms of HDI,
                            GDP
                            per capita, hospital beds so they could deal with pandemic although they were not having
                            strict
                            quarantine.

<p>The bar plot compares number of people per hundred who are fully vaccinated among 8 regions
                            as of 2/11/2021.
                            Generally, those numbers divided by three criteria are highly correlated. If a region has
                            high total vaccination, it also has high rate of people vaccinated and fully vaccinated as
                            well.
                            Regions which have the highest people fully vaccinated per hundred are Southern Europe (76),
                            Australia and New Zealand (67), Western Europe (65) and East Asia (64). These are highly
                            developed regions and with economic and technology ability, they can buy or produce enough
                            doses for their citizens.
                            On the contrary, North America, South East Asia, South Asia, Middle East have fully
                            vaccinated rate 60% or below. Governments in these regions are speeding up vaccination

<p>Line charts illustrate the timeline of vaccination process, trend of new deaths and new cases
                            (we take the new deaths and new cases as a portion of maximum new deaths and maximum new
                            cases
                            in the period respectively).
                        </p>
<p>As can be seen from the first of three graphs, vaccines were rolled out from the end of 2020.
                            Countries in Southern Europe, Western Europe, North America, Middle East were among the
                            first to
                            start the Covid-19 vaccination process. Then, South Asia, East Asia, South East Asia,
                            Australia
                            &amp; New Zealand had access to vaccines.
                        </p>
<p>Although Middle East had access to vaccines very early but they did not speed up the process
                            like other regions. In contrast, East Asia and Australia &amp; New Zealand have stable and quick
                            vaccination process. South Asia and South East Asia have been fallen behind other regions in
                            term of speeding up vaccine rate.
                        </p>
<p>Delving into more detail, data from European nations (both Southern and Western) has proved
                            that vaccines have been effective against new deaths. Since October 2021, European nations,
                            especially England, have eased social quarantine. They let their citizens to participate in
                            public events, this leads to increase in new cases. But the new deaths have not been
                            increasing
                            considerably.
                        </p>
<p>The data from Middle East and North American show the similar outcome of the effect of
                            vaccine
                            in prevent people to die from the disease.
                            The great effect of vaccines can also be seen from Asian countries. After majority of
                            continents have reached around 50% full vaccination rate, both new cases and new deaths show
                            a
                            obviously downward trend.
                        </p>
<p>There is an exception in the data that new cases and new deaths have not been decreasing
                            although vaccination process speeded up. That phenomenon occurs in Australia &amp; New Zealand
                            region. The new cases and new deaths before vaccination were really low that it can be
                            negligible. This is the result of strict lockdown imposed in this region before 2021. After
                            vaccines were widely used, goverments reopen countries and new cases and new deaths
                            increased
                            considerably. But since October 2021, both new cases and new deaths have gone down. This may
                            be
                            the time vaccines start to have effect.

<p>Pie plots show share of population, covid cases, deaths, vaccinations among regions.
                        </p>
<p>South Asia is the most populous region in 8 listed regions above. With 35.1% share of
                            population, they have contributed to 26.3%, 23.1%, 23.3% cases, deaths, vaccinations
                            respectively.
                        </p>
<p>East Asia also takes up a large portion of population but this region has extremly low cases
                            and deaths compared to other regions. This is the result r from combination of many factors
                            :
                            all social-economic criteria in polar plot (HDI, GDP per capita, number of hospital beds per
                            thousand) of East Asia are notably high. With 139 total vaccinations per hundread which
                            makes up
                            42.9% of these 8 regions, East Asia do not need to maintain strictly social distancing
                            method to
                            keep cases and deaths low.
                        </p>
<p>If we take 3 Asian regions into consideration, we can see that how East Asia outperform South
                            Asia and South East Asia in fighting against the Covid-19.

                        </p>
<p>Although North America accounts for 8.95% of population and 9.99% vaccination of these 8
                            regions, there are 30.8% cases and 36.8% deaths from this region. The same situation can be
                            witnessed in Southern Europe and Western Europe (the percentages of case and death outnumber
                            the
                            percentage of population and vaccination). Because these 3 regions consist of numerous
                            financial
                            hubs of the world, economic activities have been actively in operation regardless of how
                            severe
                            the pandemic can be. Those economic and trading activities without proper and sufficient
                            social
                            distancing rules lead to the outcome we are seeing in this figure.
                            Refering to Middle East and Australia &amp; New Zealand, their number in four pie charts are
                            relatively consistent.

<p>Hospital beds per hundred and stringency index have a strong negative correlation (-0.88). It
                            is understandable because countries which have a good health facilities tend to be more
                            confident and therefore they usually do not maintain strict social distancing rules.
                        </p>
<p>Stringency index also has a strong negative correlation with people vaccinated and people
                            fully vaccinated. The general approach of countries in the world : they will prioritize
                            economic
                            benefit after vaccination process has been conducted to some extent. Empirical study showed
                            that
                            production of goods and services have been recovering strongly after governments lifted
                            strict
                            lockdown. Those actions were necessary when community have reached herd immunity.
                            The great effect of vaccination also has been illustrated in this correlation map,
                            especially
                            in reducing number of death tolls. Although new cases and people vaccinated have correlation
                            of
                            -0.17, the number for correlation between new deaths and people vaccinated is relatively
                            high
                            (-0.66).
                        </p>
<p>Healthcare facilities also play an important role in reducing mortality rate. The heatmap
                            shows that correlations between hospital beds per thousand and new cases or new deaths are
                            both
                            around -0.5.

                            Box plot shows the number of new vaccines, new deaths and new cases of 8 selected regions
                            with
                            log scale.
                        </p>
<p>
                            Generally, regions which have high infection rate would automatically have huge new deaths
                            and
                            new vaccinations. But the difference is each regions have their own features relating to
                            pandemic response, social economic development, culture, government policy so we can see the
                            difference volatilities in three measures.
                        </p>
<p>In reference to Western Europe and Southern Europe, daily doses of vaccines have been
                            injected
                            stably at around 100000 doses everyday. Vaccination has not reduced new cases substantially
                            so
                            the distributions of new cases in both Western and Southern Europe are smooth with 3200 and
                            630
                            respectively. But the boxplot of new deaths distributions are skewed to the left and have a
                            long
                            interquartile range shows that there is a high volatility in new deaths recorded daily.
                            Since
                            vaccination process has been expanded and people have suffered from major waves, the herd
                            immunity would be achieved. Therefore, this achievement has reduced new deaths and that is
                            the
                            reason why distributions are skewed to the left.
                            Australia &amp; New Zealand imposed strict lockdown at initial stage of pandemic, but they
                            reopened borders and economic operations after when reaching specific vacccination rate.
                            This
                            leads to an increase in new cases detected.
                        </p>
<p>East Asia, as mentioned before, have late access to vaccines. However, with stringent policy
                            and fast vaccination speed, East Asia have succeeded in combating the pandemic and show how
                            effective vaccines can be.</p>

<div class="paragrah">
<p class="summary">
                            8 main graphs have show that vaccines have been playing a major role in
                            combating with the pandemic. We can say that vaccines have been an
                            effective cure to reduce number of people suffering in pandemic, especially
                            new deaths.We are expected to continue living with Covid-19, at least in the near future.
                            However, in long run, the situation can be improved with upgrade in
                            healthcare facilities, gdp per capita, human development index or advent of
                            more effective vaccines. That would be the end of pandemic which has
                            lasted for more than 2 years.
