                This is a story about the situation of the vaccine. We look at its coverage worldwide, then select the
                typical regions, then take into consideration aspects that are influenced by vaccination and other
                factors of a country such as population, government responsiveness, GDP, public sanitation facilities,
                health facilities, and poverty rates have the opposite effect on vaccination. Finally, temporarily
                answer the question of whether vaccines are effective in preventing infections or deaths, or both.

<p> WASHINGTON � When will it all end?
                            That was the question posed to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top medical adviser to President
                            Biden,
                            during a Wednesday briefing by the White House pandemic response team. It is a question that
                            Americans have been asking, with variation, for months: How much longer will we have to wear
                            masks? When will the sound of a stranger�s cough no longer incite fear of death?
                            Most broadly of all, when will the pandemic state of emergency finally come to a close, to
                            be
                            replaced by something resembling a pre-pandemic normal?
                            The answer Fauci offered on Wednesday is unlikely to offer much comfort to the impatient or
                            the
                            exhausted, in a reflection of the perilous period the nation is about to enter. According to
                            an
                            internal pandemic update circulated within the Biden administration on Wednesday, new
                            infections
                            rose by 14.1 percent between Nov. 8 and 15, while test positivity � the portion of
                            diagnostic
                            tests coming back positive � inched up 1.4 points, to 6.5 percent. During the same time
                            period,
                            hospitalizations rose by 5.4 percent. (Deaths fell by 4 percent, an encouraging development
                            possibly reflecting high vaccination rates and the increasing reliance of therapeutic
                            treatments.)
                            Parts of Europe have recently resumed restrictions, an inauspicious development, since what
                            happens there tends to presage the path of the pandemic in the U.S. �The fourth wave is

                            our country with full force,� German Chancellor Angela Merkel said earlier this week.

                            our country with full force,� German Chancellor Angela Merkel said earlier this week.

                            American leaders haven�t made similar warnings, but their signals have decidedly taken on
                            the
                            tone of caution. Gone are the days when Fauci and others touted the freedom that would come
                            with
                            �herd immunity,� a concept consigned along with �hot vax summer� to the realm of hopes
                            unrealized. With winter looming, the months ahead portend an uncomfortable, uncertain slog.

                            �We want control,� Fauci said. �And I think the confusion is, at what level of control are
                            you
                            going to accept it in its endemicity?�

                            A virus becomes endemic when it is no longer spreading at pandemic levels but is also
                            impervious
                            to actual eradication. Downgrading the coronavirus to an endemic pathogen would in effect
                            concede that we will live with it for the foreseeable future, but without the disruptions
                            caused
                            by pandemic spread.

<p>Bitstream Charter is a serif typeface designed by Matthew Carter in 1987 for Bitstream
                            Inc.[2]
                            Charter is based on Pierre-Simon Fournier�s characters, originating from the 18th
                            century.[3]
                            Classified by Bitstream as a transitional-serif typeface (Bitstream Transitional 801), it
                            also
                            has features of a slab-serif typeface and is often classified as such.[4][5]

                            Charter was originally optimized for printing on the low-resolution 300 dpi laser printers
                            of
                            the 1980s, and remains suitable for printing on both modern high-resolution laser printers
                            and
                            inexpensive lower resolution inkjet printers due to its strong, legible design. Its
                            structure
                            was optimised for low-memory computers and printers. In a 2013 interview, Carter explained
                            that
                            it used "a very simplified structure and a minimum number of curves, more straight-line
                            segments... very economical compared to, say, Times New Roman," but noted that rapid
                            development
                            of printers made this unnecessary even before he had finished the design.[6] In its
                            simplification of serif forms, it foreshadowed Carter's later landmark design, Georgia for
                            Microsoft.</p>

                            Americans have been asking, with variation, for months: How much longer will we have to wear
                            masks? When will the sound of a stranger�s cough no longer incite fear of death?
                            Most broadly of all, when will the pandemic state of emergency finally come to a close, to
                            be
                            replaced by something resembling a pre-pandemic normal?
                            The answer Fauci offered on Wednesday is unlikely to offer much comfort to the impatient or
                            the
                            exhausted, in a reflection of the perilous period the nation is about to enter. According to
                            an
                            internal pandemic update circulated within the Biden administration on Wednesday, new
                            infections
                            rose by 14.1 percent between Nov. 8 and 15, while test positivity � the portion of
                            diagnostic
                            tests coming back positive � inched up 1.4 points, to 6.5 percent. During the same time
                            period,
                            hospitalizations rose by 5.4 percent. (Deaths fell by 4 percent, an encouraging development
                            possibly reflecting high vaccination rates and the increasing reliance of therapeutic
                            treatments.)
                            Parts of Europe have recently resumed restrictions, an inauspicious development, since what
                            happens there tends to presage the path of the pandemic in the U.S. �The fourth wave is
                            hitting
                            our country with full force,� German Chancellor Angela Merkel said earlier this week.</p>

                            WASHINGTON � When will it all end?
                            That was the question posed to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top medical adviser to President
                            Biden,
                            during a Wednesday briefing by the White House pandemic response team. It is a question that

                            replaced by something resembling a pre-pandemic normal?
                            The answer Fauci offered on Wednesday is unlikely to offer much comfort to the impatient or

                            Parts of Europe have recently resumed restrictions, an inauspicious development, since what
                            happens there tends to presage the path of the pandemic in the U.S. �The fourth wave is
                            hitting
                            our country with full force,� German Chancellor Angela Merkel said earlier this week.

                            American leaders haven�t made similar warnings, but their signals have decidedly taken on
                            the
                            tone of caution. Gone are the days when Fauci and others touted the freedom that would come
                            with
                            �herd immunity,� a concept consigned along with �hot vax summer� to the realm of hopes
                            unrealized. With winter looming, the months ahead portend an uncomfortable, uncertain slog.

                            �We want control,� Fauci said. �And I think the confusion is, at what level of control are
                            you
                            going to accept it in its endemicity?�

                            A virus becomes endemic when it is no longer spreading at pandemic levels but is also
                            impervious
                            to actual eradication. Downgrading the coronavirus to an endemic pathogen would in effect
                            concede that we will live with it for the foreseeable future, but without the disruptions
                            caused
                            by pandemic spread.
