            This is a story about the situation of the vaccine. We look at its coverage worldwide, then select the
            typical regions, then take into consideration aspects that are influenced by vaccination and other
            factors of a country such as population, government responsiveness, GDP, public sanitation facilities,
            health facilities, and poverty rates have the opposite effect on vaccination. Finally, temporarily
            answer the question of whether vaccines are effective in preventing infections or deaths, or both.
